# 07. Docker

## Homework Assignment 1: Docker Installation and Basic Commands
1. Go to:  https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/
2. Follow the instruction:
```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```
3. Execute: ```docker --version```
```bash
Output:Docker version 28.0.4, build b8034c0
```
4.  Pull the official "hello-world" Docker image and run a container based on it.
```bash
debian@vbox ~/i/07.Docker (master)> sudo docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
e6590344b1a5: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:7e1a4e2d11e2ac7a8c3f768d4166c2defeb09d2a750b010412b6ea13de1efb19
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
# 07. Docker

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
# 07. Docker
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
